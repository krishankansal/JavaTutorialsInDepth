Inheritane (Reusing Classes)
----------------------------
One of the most compelling features about Java is code reuse.

youâ€™ve got to be able to do a lot more than copy code 
and change it.

You reuse code by creating new classes, but instead of creating them from scratch, you use existing classes that someone has already built and tested.

The trick is to use the classes without soiling the existing code.

Practical sesion
----------------
1. Design a class Figure with three methods in package art
    i.   void draw()
    ii.  void color()
    iii. void render()
    iv.  void resize()

2. Design a class Rectangle and extend this class with class Figure
   all three methods with the help of Rectangle class object.

3. Try to make method render() private.(See the error)
    and make method void resize() proteted

4. public, default, protected methods are inherited.(see them pratically)

5. public in any package.

6. default in same package.

7. protected in same package or by a subclass in defferent package.
    (Practically do it)

8. private with in the class only.

9. make one another class Cicle in packge gen, try to access all the
   methods of class Figure. Note the things and pen it down.

 10. define method void area() in class Circle or figure.
        --- subclass can also define methods of their own.

What about properties(instance variables) will see in video_42



Why inheritance?

1. Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

2. Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.
