static methods in java
----------------------

Q. What is a Static Method in Java?
A. A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class. This means you can call a static method without creating an object of the class. Static methods are called class methods.

Features of static method:
--------------------------

1. A static method in Java is a method that is part of a class rather than  an instance of that class.

2. Every instance of a class has access to the method.

3. Static methods have access to class variables (static variables)  without using the class’s object (instance).

4. Only static data may be accessed by a static method. It is unable to access data that is not static (instance variables).

5. In both static and non-static methods, static methods can be accessed directly.

6. Utility classes frequently employ static methods.

Methods declared as static have several restrictions:
------------------------------------------------------
    • They can only directly call other static methods of their class.
    • They can only directly access static variables of their class.
    • They cannot refer to this or super in any way. (The keyword super relates to inheritance and is described in the later videos.)
