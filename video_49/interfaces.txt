Interfaces
----------
That is, using interface, you can specify what a class must do,
but not how it does it.

one class can implement any number of interfaces.

variables can be declared inside interface declarations. 
They are implicitly final and static, meaning they cannot be changed by the implementing class. They must also be initialized. 

All methods and variables are implicitly public.

public 
protected
default
private
---------------------------------------------
interface ServiceProvider{
    
}

class Airtel implements ServiceProvider
class Vodafone implements ServiceProvider
class Jio implements ServiceProvider

Airtel airtel = new Airtel();

ServiceProvider airtel = new Airtel();

1. If a class implements an interface but do  not override all its methods then that class must be declared as abstract.

Demo ==> D.java

2. A class can be extended with another class and can also implements an interface.

class Rectangle extends Figure implemets Png, Jpeg 

3. An interface can only be public or default,
   it cannot be protected or private.

   Demo ==> Try this in A.java

4. Java Nested Interface
   ---------------------
   a) An interface, can be declared within another interface or class, is known as a nested interface or member interface.

   b) Nested interface inside another interface
      -----------------------------------------

        1. nested interface with in interface is
           by default is public. It cannot be protected
           or private.

           Demo ==> NestedInterfaceInInterface.java 

        2. Every nested interface is static by default.

        Demo ==> NestedInterfaceInInterface.java

    c) Nested interface inside a class
       -------------------------------
       The nested interface that defined inside a class must be accessed as 
       ClassName.InnerInterface

       Demo ==> NestedInterfaceInClass.java
        
5. An interface can extend with other interface
