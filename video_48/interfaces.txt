Interfaces
----------
That is, using interface, you can specify what a class must do,
but not how it does it.

one class can implement any number of interfaces.

variables can be declared inside interface declarations. 
They are implicitly final and static, meaning they cannot be changed by the implementing class. They must also be initialized. 

All methods and variables are implicitly public.

public 
protected
default
private
---------------------------------------------
interface ServiceProvider{
    
}

class Airtel implements ServiceProvider
class Vodafone implements ServiceProvider
class Jio implements ServiceProvider

Airtel airtel = new Airtel();

ServiceProvider airtel = new Airtel();
