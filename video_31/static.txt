The static can be:
------------------  
    1. Variable (also known as a class variable)
    2. Method (also known as a class method)
    3. Block

static variables in java
------------------------

1. static variables are known as class variables.
    - a class can contain two types of variables
        a) instance variables (non-static variables)
        b) class variables (static variables)

2. static variables behaves like global variables.

3. when object of a class is created or declared no copy
   of static variables is made. Instead all instances of
   of class share the same static variable.

4. They can be called without creating instance of  the class.

5. They can be called with class name.
