Generics in Java
----------------
Generics means parameterized types. The idea is to allow type (Integer, String, â€¦ etc., and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces. Using Generics, it is possible to create classes that work with different data types. 

Why Generics?
-------------
The Object is the superclass of all other classes, and Object reference can refer to any object. These features lack type safety. Generics add that type of safety feature.
