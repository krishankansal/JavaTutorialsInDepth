command line arguments
----------------------

Sometimes you will want to pass information into a program when you run it.
This is accomplished by passing command-line arguments to main( ).

To access the command-line arguments inside a Java program is quite easyâ€”they are stored as strings in a String array passed to the args parameter of main( ). The first command-line argument is stored at args[0], the second at args[1], and so on.

javac A.java
java A 10 20 
main(String args[]) "10"
